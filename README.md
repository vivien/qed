# qed

**Q.E.D.** stands for Quod Erat Dockerandum.

## Requirements

**qed** is a very simple *shell* script that only rely on
[docker](https://github.com/docker/docker).

This package must to be installed.

Depending on you distribution, you will have to run one of the commands below:

On _Ubuntu_, run

    $ sudo apt-get install docker

On _Fedora_, run

    $ sudo dnf install docker

On _Arch Linux_, run

    $ sudo pacman -S docker

## Install

**qed** needs *asciidoctor* to generate its own documentation. If it is not
installed onto you system, you may use *qed* to generate it for you.

Run directly

    $ make && sudo make install

or, using _qed_

    $ ./qed make && sudo make install

You will now be able to run something like

    $ qed -dubuntu make

from you project top directory.

## Links

**qed** is provided as _self_ example of how of setup a project.

Have a look to its [qed config](.qed/config) file and its
[Ubuntu Dockerfile](.qed/Dockerfile.ubuntu). Both files are not necessary, but
they provides a convenient way to run *qed*. Without those files you will have
to specify the distribution you want to use to every invocation of *qed*.

You may also want to check for the [qed(1)](qed.1.adoc) man-page and some basics
[usages](qed.1.adoc#examples).
