== NAME

qed(1) - run a command in a per-project container

== SYNOPSIS

*qed* [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]

== DESCRIPTION

In its simpliest form *qed(1)* executes the given command in a *docker(1)*
associated to the current working directory (or the first parent directory),
using the current user ownership.

If no command is given to the command line, *qed(1)* opens an interactive
shell if the interactive flag _-i_ is set.

If container does not exist yet, *qed(1)* creates a new one based on options
inherited from the global config file in a $XDG_CONFIG_HOME directory, the
config file in the current directory, and command line arguments.

You can think about *qed(1)* as a tool smarter than the following
*docker(1)* command:

    $ docker run -v $PWD:$PWD -w $PWD -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash

Dumping the version of the default distribution would be as trivial as:

    $ qed cat /etc/os-release | grep PRETTY_NAME
    PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS"

*qed(1)* can also list or remove one or all associated containers.

== OPTIONS

*-h*::
    show this help message

*-c*::
    local configuration directory (default to autodetect)

*-d*::
    target distribution image (a custom one can be used, like
    'my.registry/builder/ubuntu:10.04')

*-i*::
    enter interactive mode

*-b*::
    force re-build of a local docker base image

*-p*::
    force pull of docker base image from registry

*-f*::
    force re-creation of the docker container

*-w*::
    enable moonwalk mode (usefull when running qed commands in subdirectories)

*-r*::
    remove all containers associated to current working directory

*-q*::
    quiet mode (do not show qed log messages)

== EXAMPLES

Some examples of *qed(1)* use case:

Run an interactive shell inside the docker image

    $ qed -i

Run make inside the docker image

    $ qed make

Run an interactive make menuconfig inside the docker image

    $ qed -i make menuconfig

Rebuild the docker image if the *Dockerfile(5)* has been updated

    $ qed -b
